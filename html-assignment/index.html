        <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>I grew up in a small village called Lakefield, just outside of Peterborough.  <abbr title="I have">I've</abbr> taken french immersion, and did a high school arts program with a focus in both visual arts and music.  I have also completed an esthetics program at <abbr title="Fleming College">FC</abbr> and have worked in a spa for roughly 2 years.  I figure skated for most of my life until an injury prevented me from continuing, though I’ve recently been trying to learn how to roller skate.  I play the ukulele, and can play some basic songs on the guitar.</p>
         
         <p>I’ve <strong>always</strong> dreamed of being a content creator, whether that’s making websites and marketing campaigns, or making entertaining videos on TikTok.  I’ve always been interested in design, and I love <em>interior decorating, makeup artistry, and making collages</em>.  I’m looking forward to improving my skills in photography as it’s been 3 years since I've taken my high school photography class.  So far I’ve found the programming component of this program to be very interesting and am <strong>excited</strong> to see what all I’ll be able to create with the information I learn this semester.</p>
